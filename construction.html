    		<h1>Construction</h1>
			<p>The construction of the Educational Tall Ship will bring together the best of the past, present and future.</p>
			<p>Our goal is to build a sailing ship that can meet her own energy needs through regenerative power technologies. Utilizing an innovative hybrid drive, the vessel will be combining the best of present day technology and traditional knowledge all with an eye towards a better environmental future for the bay.</p>
			<p>This ship will be sustainably built and operated well into the future. By combining appropriate technologies from the 19<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, the ship becomes a unique teaching tool that can inspire appreciation for past designs, innovative solutions and address the long-range consequences of dated technologies and help build a world with a more sustainable future.</p>
			<p>Additionally, we will be utilizing the latest techniques in sustainable procurement and construction.</p>
			<p>All of the lumber for the construction will be certified sustainably harvested and locally sourced. The construction management process will implement the latest in "lean production" techniques that greatly reduce waste and cost overruns, and insure a project run on-schedule. The team at the Educational Tall Ship is dedicated to running and operating the project as a model of sustainability and responsibility.</p>
			<p>For the construction phase the Educational Tall Ship we will hire local craftspeople and artisans. This professional crew will work alongside volunteers as well as training a new generation of sailors and builders through our apprenticeship program.</p>
