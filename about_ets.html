            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p>To build a wooden tall ship for the San Francisco Bay Area that will teach youth about marine ecology, sustainability, and maritime history.<br />
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1>Vision</h1>
            <br />
            <h2><em><span>Building a Ship</span></em></h2>
            <p><span>The Educational Tall Ship project is nearing the construction phase. Our vessel will be the first wooden tall ship built in the Bay Area in almost 100 years and is the largest ship of this kind to incorporate sustainable building practices. The project will provide on-the-water and shore-based experiential education for students of all ages, both during construction and after completion.<br><br /></span></p>
            <h2><em><span>Building a Community</span></em></h2>
            <p><span>The Educational Tall Ship project aims to serve the San Francisco Bay area by actively engaging with members of the community and partner organizations. During the construction we will utilize community volunteers as well as youth education programs making our vessel truly a community effort. We welcome your support. </span></p>
            <h2><span>Join Us!<br></span></h2>
            <p><span>Support for the Educational Tall Ship project advances nautical and natural education in the San Francsico Bay Area, for the health of our people and our planet. </span></p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>Educational Tall Ship will inspire people to celebrate and experience the rich maritime history of the Bay Area, learn about and preserve our delicate ecosystem and provide life-changing experiential learning opportunities for youth of all backgrounds, now and for generations to come.</p>
            <p>The need for this vessel has never been greater. Our operating partner <a href="http://www.callofthesea.org/" target="_blank">Call of the Sea</a> is an established non-profit that is the premier provider of on-the-water educational experiences in the Bay Area. <a href="http://www.callofthesea.org" target="_blank">Call of the Sea</a> has reached capacity with their 82' schooner <em>Seaward</em> taking more than 3500 kids per year out to experience the bay and ocean first-hand.</p>
            <p>With the construction of the Educational Tall Ship, <a href="http://www.callofthesea.org/" target="_blank">Call of the Sea</a> will be able to increase their capacity threefold and offer opportunities for more than 10,000 kids every year. On top of that, working with other partners and charter programs we will be able to offer experiences for people of all ages to get out on the Bay and make excursions out on the ocean.</p>
            <p>Imagine the graceful lines of a Tall  Ship, an echo of San Francisco's rich maritime heritage, tacking her way  under the Gate or appearing out of the fog under full sail like a 19th  century ghost. On her decks and aloft will be Bay Area youth of all  backgrounds and abilities working and learning together,sailing her  confidently, their faces bright with a sense of adventure and  achievement.</p>
            <div> San Francisco Bay is truly one of the most beautiful and dynamic ports  in the world. It is renowned as a destination and point of origin for  commercial shipping, tourism and sailing at all levels. Some of the best  sailors in the world-Olympic winners, Whitbread winners, America's Cup  winners and challengers- have honed their skill on the challenging winds  and currents of the Bay.<br> <br>And now with plans for the America's Cup to be held here in 2013, the world will see a Historic Tall Ship being built during the San Francisco hosted event.<br> <br></div>
            </div>
            <p>Communities around the coasts of the United States  and throughout the world are investing energy and resources in creating  these beautiful ambassador ships with valuable training programs. In the  USA starting in the 1970s, one new Tall Ship has been launched almost  every year. On the West Coast, Los Angeles, San Diego, Seattle,  Vancouver and other smaller cities have their own Tall Ship. San  Franciscoalso deserves her own Tall Ship gracing these magnificent Bay  waters, offering our communities the chance to be a part of history, and to expand their experience and appreciation of where we live.</p>
