            <h3>Executive Director</h3><br />

Alan heads the project and brings the vision to the organization. Alan’s 50 years of maritime experience, in construction, engineering, restoration and sailing, makes him uniquely suited to run such a project. In 1961, Alan built a 40 ft catamaran in Minnesota and sailed down the Mississippito the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. His work in boat yards in Florida included being lead carpenter on the building of a 85 foot catamaran and solidified his interest and passion for everything nautical.In 1971 he began construction of Stone Witch, a 70’ brigantine .  From 1977 on,he sailed Stone Witch over 40,000 miles, operating educational sailing programs for youth and adults along with public charters on San Francisco Bay.  Stone Witch was the flag ship for Greenpeace and involved in many environmental missions along the California Coast.  The majority of that time Stone Witch operated without an engine, operating in a traditional manner requiring great skill and leadership.In 1984 Alan founded the non-profit organization Call of the Sea.  Call of the Sea’s  mission is to provide a challenging, hands-on, educational experience aboard a traditional sailing vessel.  In 2005, Call of the Sea’s 82’ schooner Seaward was acquired and has served over 15,000 students while sailing over 40,000 miles on day and overnight educational youth programs.In the 1980’s Alan restored a 1929, 54ft wooden staysail schooner to use in youth educational programs with Call of the Sea and on educational expeditions with adults that included seven trips to Mexico and a 15,000 mile Pacific Rim voyage that included China.
