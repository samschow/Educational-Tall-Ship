			<p>Our goal is to build an educational sailing ship that can meet her own energy needs through regenerative power technologies. This ship can be sustainably built and sustainably operated well into the future. By combining appropriate technologies from the 19th and 21st centuries - skipping over the petroleum era - the ship becomes a unique teaching tool that can inspire appreciation for past designs, innovative solutions and address the long-range consequences of dated technologies to build a world with a more sustainable future.</p>
			<p>Day-to-day operations are designed to minimize energy and water use with a waste management system that will use the best methods to repurpose, recycle and reduce waste. LED lighting, induction cooking, low energy navigation and appliances will help us use less than 50kWh per day, the amount used by an average three bedroom house.</p>
			<p>The basic hybrid concept is simple. Instead of diesel engines, the ship is propelled by DC electric motors directly connected to the propeller shafts and drawing energy from large battery banks. When the ship is sailing, the propellers will rotate by the energy of the passing water causing the electric motors to become generators. Significant electrical energy is created as sailing speeds increase.</p>
			<p>New advances in propellers, electric propulsion/regeneration motors, battery technologies and electronic controllers make this possible and are available today. Our Ship can operate on a carbon neutral basis. Energy to run our ship will come from regenerative power under sail, onboard generators fueled with recycled vegetable oil, and dockside charging from solar panels and wind generators.</p>
			<p>Energy self-sufficiency can be achieved by producing and storing enough energy from just four to six hours of sailing. The regenerative system is designed to produce as much as 50kw in the usual San Francisco Bay sailing conditions. The battery banks can store 200kw hours of usable energy. When the wind is too light to sail, the ship can power up to 12 knots. At 6 knots under electric power it will take four hours to use half of the power available in the battery banks. The remaining 100kw hours will power all non-propulsion ship's needs: lighting, cooking, saltwater desalination, climate control, navigation, communications and waste management for 48 hours.</p>
