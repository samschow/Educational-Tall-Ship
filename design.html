    		<h1>Our Design</h1>
			<p>Our vessel will be the first wooden ship of this size built in San Francisco in nearly 100 years. Inspired by the 19th century Brigantine “Galilee”, she will be 100 feet long on deck and have a 25 foot beam.</p>
			<p>The Brigantine is a two-masted vessel with square sails on the forward mast and stay sails aft. Aloft, she will be able to set more than 7100 square feet of sail. Her overall displacement will be 176 tons and she will draw ten feet of water allowing the vessel to service most of the ports in the Bay Area.&nbsp; She will also be certified for open ocean sailing making passage to any port in the world a possibility.</p>
			
			<h2>History</h2>
<div id="Oobj62">
<div id="Grtf45" class="dfltt"><span class="txt0"><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><img src="/storage/turner.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1325812308870" alt=""></span>Matthew Turner and his ships represent a pivotal time  in San Francisco Bay Area history.&nbsp; Captain Turner left his home on the  shores of Lake Erie for the gold fields of California in 1850 to try  his luck. More successful than many, he found enough gold to travel back  East to purchase a ship, for he saw more opportunity in shipping than  gold in the long run. Starting in the booming coastal&nbsp; lumber trade, he  soon needed more ships. Not impressed with what was available in the  ships at that time, he pulled together what he had learned from his  father about design and building on Lake Erie and his experience from  contemporary vessels in the Pacific to build his first ship the Nautilus  in 1868. The Nautilus outperformed all other ships, raising the bar in  sailing ship design. At that time on the East Coast, design innovation  in commercial sail was at a standstill as steamships became the focus.  Here on the West Coast, long distances, lack of coal and developed  industrial capacity to produce large steam engines gave sail the edge  until the turn of the century.</span></div>
<div class="dfltt"><span class="txt0"><br></span></div>

<p><span class="txt0">The Nautilus launched Turner as the West Coast's most  prolific builder with 228 vessels built by the end of his career in  1907. His vessels also launched many other entrepreneurs.<br> <br> Matson lines began with the Lurlene. Spreckles Sugar had a fleet of  Turner's ships, as did C&amp;H Sugar, moving between San Francisco and  Hawaii at steamship speeds- making 13 round trips in one year, including  loading and unloading.&nbsp; Only the largest and fastest modern sailing  yachts can hope to best (and few manage) the 8 days, 6 hours from San  Francisco to Honolulu by the Lurlene and 9 days back from Honolulu by  the W.G. Irwin. Turner himself discovered the Alaska cod industry and  owned and operated the first packet ships between San Francisco and  Tahiti.<br> <br> It seems fitting that an immigrant to the Bay Area like Turner, with  innovative ideas and methods, who worked to develop new technology in  his time and was highly successful, should become the inspiration for  our new tall ship design.<br> </span></p>
